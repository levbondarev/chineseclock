Chinese Clock is a project dedicated to ancient Chinese way of timekeeping.
The end of the day which was pegged to about 19:12 local time, was a start of a new day.
The Ten Heavenly Stems (10 special symbols which are used to enumerate things in chinese texts even today) were used for defining "hours", spanning all 24 convenient hours in 10 spans from Jia (甲) to Gui (癸). 
Then, 100 fen in each "hour" and 100 miao in each "fen" were used.
So, the "miao" unit is actually smaller, than one second and is equal to ~0.864 second.
The program starts in a minimized window and the taskbar button serves to display time. The hour is displayed as an icon, and fen&miao are displayed as text.
